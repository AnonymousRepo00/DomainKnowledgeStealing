  "By what principal discriminative features define Anatomy?": "Anatomy is principally defined by the study of the structure and organization of living organisms, with a primary focus on the form, arrangement, and relationships of body parts. The discriminative features of anatomy include the identification and description of tissues, organs, and systems at both macroscopic (gross anatomy) and microscopic (histology) levels. Gross anatomy examines structures visible to the naked eye, such as muscles, bones, and organs, often through dissection and imaging techniques. Microscopic anatomy, or histology, investigates cellular and tissue architecture using light and electron microscopy.\n\nAnatomy is further characterized by its systematic and regional approaches. The systematic approach studies the body by organ systems, such as the cardiovascular, nervous, or musculoskeletal systems, emphasizing the functional integration of anatomical structures. The regional approach examines all anatomical structures within a specific area of the body, such as the thorax or abdomen, highlighting spatial relationships and clinical relevance.\n\nAnother principal feature is the use of standardized anatomical terminology, as outlined by the Terminologia Anatomica, to ensure precise and universal communication among healthcare professionals. This includes terms for planes, directions, and positions, which are essential for describing the location and orientation of anatomical structures.\n\nAnatomy also distinguishes itself by its emphasis on developmental (embryology) and comparative aspects, exploring how structures form during ontogeny and how they vary among different species. This comprehensive approach allows anatomy to serve as the foundational science for understanding physiological function, clinical examination, surgical intervention, and medical imaging, as recognized in medical education guidelines such as those from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME)."
